## Index

My Index uses [JSFlickity 2.2](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) which allows me to create highly customizable sliders that can hold multiple types of content. The only problem with [jsflickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) is the responsive resize only triggers after the page has finished being resized. This means that it lags behind when changing the screen width.

The [jsflickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) contains a youtube embed. The embed causes cookies issues but I don't believe these to be a problem as my website doesn't utilize cookies anyway.

___

## About

The about page is simple, containing text, images and a youtube embed. This youtube embed still causes the same issues as the one on the [index](#index) page.

This page contains photos from the Tawa College 2022 Formal and performances from Blue Notes and Jazz Band at July Jams in 2021 The video is a performance of us rehearsing our first released song Reimbursed for the first time.
___

## Music

The music page contains lyrics for all of our publicly released songs as well as audio previews. There are also images to go along with each song which disappear when on smaller screen sizes.


I created all of the audio previews with the [spotify embed tool](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/embeds/). This seems to work great on the surface but causes lots of console errors. Unfortunately, I am unable to debug these errors as spotify seems to be using some sort of DRM software that blocks me from changing its attributes.

## Contact

My contact form uses code from [Jamie Wilson's Google Sheets Repository](https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets) which is a easy way to create a proof of concept contact form that works.
