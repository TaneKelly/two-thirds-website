				<div class="about-title">RUMPUS</div>
				<div class="about-desc">
					Rumpus is an album created by the Tawa College four piece band, Two
					Thirds. Usually our lineup consists of Oscar Garvie on the drums, Liam
					Reburn playing guitar, Tane Kelly playing bass or keys, and Nick
					Murphy singing and playing guitar. Music is a big part of our lives,
					and because we spend so much time together in the Music Block, writing
					an album came pretty naturally to us.

				<div class="about-desc">
					Playing at the school formal has to be one of our highlights from our
					time at Tawa, where we debuted our first single, ‘Reimbursed’ to a
					very enthusiastic crowd.

				<div class="about-desc">
					It’s been a pleasure and a privilege being a part of the Tawa College
					Music Department over the past 5 years. Strong bonds are built within
					the music community through all the different groups that are
					available, such as the choirs and instrumental ensembles. So many good
					memories, good minutes, and much more.

				<div class="about-title">Tawa College</div>
				<div class="about-desc">
					Sadly we will be departing Tawa College to move onto tertiary
					education, but we are still very keen to pursue music and keep the
					band alive. There are plans for new music such as a potential second
					album including many bangers.

				<div class="about-desc">
					Recording and writing songs does take a fair amount of time, but it’s
					definitely a blast and we’d recommend it to anyone considering
					creating music of their own. Everyone should give it a go! All of us
					would say we are very happy with how our musical journeys have gone
					and we are grateful for all the support given to us from the music
					teachers and everyone who has listened to our music.
