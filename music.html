						danced along the shore where we first met <br>
						<br>
						(cos) I've seen you walkin round with that friend of yours This is

						The reflection in the lake points out all your flaws <br>
						You don't have to try hide your scars <br>

						Sky blue eyes stare back at me <br>

						I've been enjoying your company <br>

						(cos) I've seen you walkin round with that friend of yours <br>
						This is not who you truly are <br>
						The reflection in the lake points out all your flaws <br>
						You don't have to try hide your scars <br>

						you don't know her like I do <br>
						you don't see the way I love her, (the way I love her) <br>
						If you could see just how sweet she can be <br>
